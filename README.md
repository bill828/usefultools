# usefultools
This is a repo for me to store useful tools written by me.

## jdkselector
This is a tool written by bash.

I may install several JDKs on my linux box, but it's not easy to switch to another version of JDK. To do this, I have to
change two environment variables, such as `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH`.

This tool can help me to switch to another version of JDK under `/usr/local/jdk`.
